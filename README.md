# Problem description

- Model visualy using a MER diagram the desired database adressing all the performance and consistency issues;
- Control the code versioning to keep track of changes;
- Implement the model and construct the data warehouse using SQL.

# Modeling design choices

Before modeling the database some decisions regarding its architecture must be made. The first is the schema used, the schema defines how the tables are related to each other.

In our case, as the most complex problem to be solved is consistency, I chose to use the snowflake schema. When modeling using the snowflake schema, the dimension tables are normalized in such a way that there is no redundant data that causes this consistency problem.

In addition, even if the snowflake schema ends up needing more complex queries and, consequently, with a longer execution time, the fact that the large table is reduced to small tables will make the execution of the queries faster.

Finally, the other reason I chose this schema over the star schema is that databases using the snowflake schema tend to take up less space, which is critical given the current size of the aforementioned table.

# Modeling the database

To model the database I will follow 5 basic steps described bellow:

- [Identify entities and attributes](#entities-and-attributes): the first thing to do is to know your data. In this step I will study the column names, try to aggregate them as attributes of various entities.
- [Create the fact tables](#fact-table-creation): after knowing the data, decide which metrics are important to the business, thus creating the columns of the fact table.
- [Create the dimension tables](#dimension-tables-creation): the dimension tables are auxiliray tables that contains descriptive attributes of the data, create those tables is the next step.
- Normalize dimension tables: in the snowflake schema the dimension tables are normalized to avoid redundancy and improve performance
- Create the relation between tables: relate the fact and dimension tables, also create the relationship between the dimension tables and its helper tables. This process is made by adding primary and foreign keys.


## Entities and attributes
The first thing to do is divide the data into categories. The division is arbitrary, in this case I created four categories:

- Account: account attributes for example client type, number of spaces, password, status, etc.
- Card: every card related attribute such as number of virtual cards, cards last digits, card 
color, etc.
- Person: attributes related to a person like cellphone characteristics, location, contact info, etc.
- Transaction: dates of any type of transaction - debit or credit card, pix, digital wallets.


## Fact table creation:
Observing the given column names, it is possible to verify that there is not a column that reports a fact in itself. This way I had two options: create new columns for facts, or build a fact table based on events. The decidision to use a event based approach was chosen at first, but was discarded. So I created some new columns to use as facts. 

The first created fact table is about transactions. Every transaction store its value, date, location and type. 

The second one is about accounts. It stores various boolean values about ana account like if it is free or payed, active or not, have an active loan or not, and some personal info.

The third one is a customer fact that will store personal information of customer.

The last fact table is about cards. It stores thing like the number of cards an account have, the limit of the card, the color, request and received date, etc.

    TransactionFact {
        int    transaction_id PK
        int    date_id FK
        int    location_id FK
        int    transaction_type_id FK
        int    value
    }

    AccountFact {
        int    account_id PK
        int    account_dates_id FK
        int    device_id FK
        int    account_status_id FK
        binary password
        int    balance
        int    number_of_spaces
        string corp_name
    }

    CustomerFact {
        int    customer_id PK
        int    birth_date_id FK
        int    location_id FK
        int    device_id FK
        int    customer_status_id FK
        int    age
        int    monthly_income
        string cellphone_number
        string email
        string mothers_name
    }

    CardFact {
        int    card_id PK
        int    card_dates_id FK
        int    number_of_cards
        int    card_limit
        string card_color
        string tracking_status
    }
```
</div>

## Dimension tables creation:
The dimension tables are created based on the fact tables foreign keys. Considreing that we need 8 different dimensions.

erDiagram

    DimDate {
        int  date_id PK
        int  day
        int  month
        int  year
        date date
    }

    DimAccountDates {
        int account_dates_id PK
        int creation_date_id FK
        int cancelation_date_id FK
        int doc_submition_date_id FK
        int last_login_date_id FK
        int onboarding_end_date_id FK
        int onboarding_start_date_id FK
        int inactivation_date_id FK
    }

    DimCardDates {
        int request_date_id FK
        int received_date_id FK
        int bill_expiration_date_id FK
    }
    DimLocation {
        int    location_id PK
        string country
        string state
        string city
        string neighborhood
        string street
    }

    DimDevice {
        int    device_id PK
        string device_model
        string device_operator
        string device_os
        string app_version
    }

    DimTransactionType {
        int    transaction_type_id PK
        string type
        bool   in_out
    }

    DimAccountStatus {
        int  account_status_id PK
        bool account_active
        bool credit_pre_approved
        bool free
        bool loan_active
        bool pix_active
        bool person_type
    }

    DimCustomerStatus {
        int  customer_status_id PK
        bool marital_status
        bool ppe
    }

```
</div>

Combining these two diagrams we can see the snowflake form. Although transaction and customer facts references directly the date dimension, the account and card facts references it indirectly using another dimension table.
